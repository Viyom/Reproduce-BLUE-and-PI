#Steps to reproduce ns-3 results of BLUE paper

Step 1: Install ns-3.26 (Clone it from: `http://code.nsnam.org/ns-3.26`)

Step 2: Copy `"blue-queue-disc.h"` and `"blue-queue-disc.cc"` from this directory and paste them in `ns-3.26/src/traffic-control/model`

Step 3: Copy `"wscript"` from this directory and paste it in `ns-3.26/src/traffic-control/` (it will overwrite the existing one)

Step 4: Recompile ns-3
